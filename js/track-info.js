Some holidays just get the short end of the stick. Why is it that days based on mathematical constants (you know who you are) lack the public awareness of days marking religious or historical significance? It\'s just not rational.\n\n\
Thanks to <a href="http://www.weirdal.com/" target="_blank">Weird Al</a> and his "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t039p6xqutU" target="_blank">Christmas at Ground Zero</a>" for the idea to give it a holiday sound by using sleigh bells. I was thinking about using the baritone sax as well, but decided it didn\'t work in this case.\n\n\
EDIT: New version for π Day 2013! I rethought the sax and decided it works after all. Added a uke, accordion, and moving left hand on the piano, and kicked up the energy. Hope you like it. '

[Verse 1]\n\
I don\'t seem to sleep a lot now when it\'s raining.\n\
I don\'t need to watch my step, I know this road.\n\
The winter snaps at my skin. I guess that I should care, or something,\n\
But I don\'t seem to notice lately when it\'s cold.\n\
Breath embraces the mist, becomes it, hides away in the shadows.\n\
There\'s nothing left but letting go,\n\
\n\
[Chorus]\n\
And then there\'s one more cloud.\n\
Like a final breath into the wind, she dances away.\n\
And the tolling echoes loudly,\n\
And the raindrops eat away, bite by bite \'til nothing remains\n\
And as the chiming fades it\'s 3 a.m. I must be lonely.\n\
\n\
[Verse 2]\n\
She\'d have wanted to be somewhere else that\'s warmer.\n\
She always liked herself a sunny, tropic shore.\n\
Who knows? Maybe that\'s where she\'ll be carried, maybe not,\n\
But this is really not about her anymore.\n\
Every word that was said or wasn\'t, every torturous regret\n\
All I can do is let them go,\n\
\n\
[Chorus]\n\
\n\
A life in ashes and a raincoat, and immutable, final loss\n\
The simple act of letting go,\n\

		notes: 'So then out of nowhere, I write a serious song. And not serious like "<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/briangraymusic/songs/when-you-get-there" target="_blank">When You Get There</a>", but serious and not even a little bit geeky. For this one, I\'m going to leave it up to you. The lyrics are pretty ambiguous, so if you like mystery in your music then listen, enjoy, and imagine that it means what you imagine it to mean. It was written for the SpinTunes songwriting contest as a sequel to "3 A.M." by Matchbox Twenty. If you\'d like to know what it means to me, feel free to read...<br /><br /><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/briangraymusic/songs/one-more-cloud/one-more-cloud-bio" target="_blank">THE BIO</a><br /><br />The opinions of this song were about as varied as it can get. Out of 6 judges, 2 liked it and placed it in the middle of the pack (partially because of poor mixing which has mostly been fixed), three placed it at or near last place, and one thought it was the best song of the round and placed it first. The optimist in me makes the argument that any great work of art must necessarily be unacceptable to a sizable portion of those who experience it. The pessimist in me counters with the premise that the optimist is "a doo-doo head". They may both be right.<br /><br />The judge that placed me first -- Dr. Lindyke -- wrote up a detailed review. It gives away almost as much as the bio, and indeed I replied in the comments section with thoughts that I have since added to the bio itself. So read if you don\'t mind the mystery being spoiled:<br /><br /><a href="http://music.cratchit.org/2010/10/deconstructing-one-more-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deconstructing "One More Cloud"<br /></a>'

		lyrics: '\
[Verse 1]\n\
So today\'s the day I finally bridge the strait of Charybdis and Scylla,\n\
Dividing secrets of my heart,\n\
Disobey instinct and circumnavigate the 800 lb gorilla,\n\
Forever keeping us apart\n\
And I\'ve bet the farm I won\'t end up\n\
Harming the lady cradled in my arm, while you journey up to me.\n\
\n\
[Chorus]\n\
So I guess I\'ve been playing hard to get, what with these springs and barrels.\n\
To be or not to be beset, by Cupid\'s slings and arrows.\n\
But I think it\'s time for you to find out what you haven\'t found out yet:\n\
That I\'m not so hard to get.\n\
\n\
[Verse 2]\n\
I got my big brother\'s plan to imitate, followed almost to the letter:\n\
One decoy girl to apprehend.\n\
Gonna try now to ascend the Empire State, with the consequences better.\n\
I\'ll get my plumber in the end.\n\
It\'s not so simple to scale Olympus,\n\
But you inspire this humble chimp to embrace our destiny.\n\

I\'m not some raiding faun to your Diana. I want to know what makes you you.\n\
I feel there\'s flavors here besides banana, and I feel you feel it too.\n\
\n\
[Verse 3]\n\
And I know you dream of honor\'s greater share, like Henry and his neighbors.\n\
Your battle all the fates demand.\n\
Set aglow your heart as guide, and don\'t despair the Sisyphean labors\n\
You will endure to win my hand.\n\
Then we\'ll discover the secret\n\
Of the ones who inspire songs of love, and touch immortality.\n\

		notes: 'Challenge: <i>Write a song from the point of view of a videogame character.</i><br /><br />Turns out I\'m actually not much of a gamer. While I do own a PS3 and a Wii, I just don\'t spend all that much time playing games anymore. When I did, my favorite franchises were Metroid, Castlevania, Zelda, and Mario, probably in that order. My first instinct was Samus from Metroid, but I couldn\'t convince my wife to sing the part. So then I reached back into my distant childhood and pulled out the really old stuff, from the dawn of video gaming itself: Pacman, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, TRON, Galaga, etc.<br /><br />As luck would have it, I already happen to be sitting on a Pacman-related song idea. As luck would also have it, my song when written will be in the 3rd person, and as such is not appropriate for this 1st person challenge. The next option was Donkey Kong. I tossed it around a bit and came up with a few key "what if"s:<br /><br /><ol><li>What if Kong was actually pretty bright and educated, and liberally referenced Shakespeare and Greek classics, to the point of grating pretension?</li><li>What if he still felt the pull of his inner ape instinct, and struggled against it?<br /></li><li>What if he wasn\'t really interested in the princess at all, but instead was attracted to Mario (then "Jumpman") and was just using her for bait?</li></ol>Taking the role of speculative fiction writer, I let flow with the "what if"s, and here we are. No matter how intelligent Kong is, I never could get over the fact that this plan is fundamentally flawed, and that he\'s doomed to failure (especially if Mario is straight, and really just wants the princess). But his sincerity is inspiring, and hope springs eternal...'

[Verse 1]\n\
Hey there, it may be just my current state,\n\
But I swear, I haven\'t seen a girl like you since 1348.\n\
And really by then she was almost gone.\n\
You\'ve got that "absence of boils and pus" thing really going on.\n\

Lalalalalalala never mind, just pass one over here.\n\

		notes: 'Long time no see. I\'ve been out of the game for a while, and "the game" happened to include an entire SpinTunes competition. Now I want to get back into writing music, but they\'re like "not so fast. You need to complete 4 challenges before continuing." Like a video game, but with a lot more work.<br /><br />So here\'s challenge #1: Write a happy song about death.<br /><br />This challenge may sound familiar, as it\'s the opposite of the one that produced the shadow entry <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/briangraymusic/songs/not-even-close" target="_blank">Not Even Close</a>. This time however, I\'m really trying to meet the challenge and write a truly happy song. And what could be happier than Death on vacation, right?<br /><br />I really dig the chords in this one. I lean on the juxtaposition of a chromatically descending line in the (minor) verse and ascending in the (major) chorus, but neither of them bass lines. A couple augmented chords like I did in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/briangraymusic/songs/she-said" target="_blank">She Said</a>. The mixture of feels between Caribbean, Latin American, and rock gives it an energy I like. It\'s also my first time making a conscious decision to accelerate going into the first chorus when the key changes to major. Finally, I\'m definitely getting better at mixing vocals. Still not professional sounding, but closer.'

This just in. Did you hear about the politician whose campaign depends on raising money?\n\
Schools have been searching high and low for where the curiosity of little children goes.\n\
A governmental agency has somehow managed not to manage funds.\n\
Extra, extra, well that\'s news to me.\n\
\n\
Just today, this famous entertainer said offensive things, and now the world is all offended.\n\
Hard to say out of all the worthy artists nominated who will win the big award.\n\
A person I should know about is divorcing after not too long a time.\n\
And I can\'t believe it. That\'s news to me.\n\
\n\
Dog bit man last night. It\'s right there in black and white.\n\
Should I care somehow despite my TPS report due tomorrow?\n\
\n\
There\'s a place far away from here where two adjacent countries don\'t agree upon their borders.\n\
The human race now totals seven billion people who have stories each unique in their own way.\n\
The paper by the bread cart says the circus plans on rolling into town.\n\
This changes everything, and it\'s news to me.',
		notes: 'Starting to get a new-found respect for all the other songwriters who commit to a song a week. This was only my second challenge, but I\'m feeling the stress. Even during an awesome evening out at Cirque du Soleil I found myself entertaining fleeting thoughts about whether I would finish on time. All went better than expected. I finished, and even got a bit of inspiration from my evening at the circus.<br /><br />Challenge #2: <i><b>BREAKING NEWS!</b> - You‘re writing a topical song.  The challenge is pretty wide open, but there are some restrictions.  Topical is going to be defined as something from a headline in a newspaper no older than 2 weeks from today.  You can use your local newspaper or a major publication.  You\'re even allowed to use the online versions of major publications.  You will be required to include a link to the story that inspired your song, or attach a scan from the newspaper.</i><br /><br />For the record, my initial inspiration for this song was in fact a headline from the L.A. Times that read "Obama\'s Campaign Strategy Hinges on Lots of Cash". Still, I never would have written this song as a real entry in the real competition, as it would probably be considered a DQ by means of not primarily being about one current headline. Individually, every line about news is actually a real story within the past 2 weeks, but the song isn\'t <b>about</b> any of them, and definitely isn\'t about anything "topical". If I\'m being generous, I\'ll say it\'s timeless (except for the 7 billion thing). But whatever, that\'s the beauty of shadowing.'

Memories of something to forgive. The miracle of how you live\n\
Like a thing possessed.\n\

To burn me to the core.\n\

		notes: 'At long last, my 4th and final song of November 2011.<br /><br /><i>Challenge #4: Write a song inspired by this <a href="http://reinfriedmarass.com/blog/classic-car-wreck-cadillac-de-ville" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reinfried Marass photo</a>.<br /></i><br />I was really fatigued by the end there. Been writing music every evening and every weekend this month, excepting the few days I spent feeling guilty for not writing music. Like Thanksgiving. The broad strokes of an idea for this (love song for Stephen King\'s <a href="http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/christine.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Christine</a>) came easily and immediately, but the song wasn\'t happening. I started to lose faith and look for another topic.<br /><br />But it kept nagging at me. I had a hook I liked that changed keys by starting on a V/vi, and I was dead set on using it wherever my other decisions led me. My mistake was feeling since it was a love song it had to be a ballad, and in a simple piano or guitar orchestration. Finally when I randomly tried a rock pattern, it just sounded good so I kept with it.<br /><br />Despite my intentions, it is my opinion that the entire song could be interpreted as a discarded man retreating into drugs to escape feeling anything. I\'ve heard it said on occasion that the artist\'s intention is immaterial, so maybe to some that\'s what it\'s about. But it\'s actually a car in the woods, hoping his Christine returns to him before either the mechanical stresses of the Earth or rust win the battle to destroy him.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Technical stuff: gain staging! You can all laugh at me for not learning this until my 16th song, but this song was so much easier to mix than the others -- and ended up blending better too -- all because of gain staging. See, in the analog world, you can shoot for 0dB, and overs go over. When working with digital, not only do overs get clipped, but effects and processors don\'t work very cleanly near the top. So the first thing I did was add a Gain/Trim plug-in to every track and adjust it so that it peaks at -15dB (some use -12, other as low as -20). Then I did the same to every effect I added, making sure the output peaked again at -15dB. Thus, when the sounds hit the faders and I played the song, they all right across the board peak at -15dB. That\'s when I start mixing with the faders, but from a super clean signal that knits together much better than before.'

		notes: 'Right on the tail of my fake entries into SpinTunes 3, they host an actual competition, creatively named "SpinTunes 4". Challenge 1:<br /><br /><i><b>Night Terrors</b> - Write a song about a childhood nightmare. Include significant use of rubato.</i><br /><br />So this kid\'s nightmare is that his life will be "normal". I pictured myself visiting me at work and watching me sit there and type, and got bored just thinking about it. There was no way for me as a kid to imagine that such a thing could actually be fun to do. I love writing software, enough that I do it on my own time after I get home from work. But to a kid it must appear boring as all get out. Plus, I got to vent about such irritants as printers and heavyweight processes (hands up, anyone who has to deploy software in compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley). Bonus.<br /><br />I didn\'t mean to get as depressing as this song could be taken. I\'m thinking, "ha ha, it\'s funny cause this kid has an unrealistic idea of what adult life will be like," and then my laughs fade out and I\'m all, "damn, this is just sad. Who has Cheetos?" That\'s what happens when I use the whole week to write the song: it evolves from one feeling to another. But I\'m happy with the result.<br /><br />The music itself was really fun to work on. The verses are all over the place. Start in A, but then hit a G chord, eventually follow with a C, and an E7 leads to the chorus where the C9 represents a sub-dominant that resolves down to a G. Basically I just let the melody guide me and that\'s where it led, but along the way, I played up the "weirdness" of the progressions during the part of the song that describes "normal" life, while getting very simple and straightforward when the lyrics are unrealistic. Leaving the chorus, the descending melody gets me back to E7, resolving back to A for the second verse, but then veers up to Bb for the bridge. I just let that move forward in Bb with a harmonic structure that mirrors the verses, so when we get back to the chorus we find we\'re a half step up from before. Gives it a bit more energy for the home stretch, but without the obvious half-step modulation that\'s typically used.<br /><br />Also had fun cranking up the noise in the verses via distortion on the guitar and a shaken box of silverware, speeding up the tempo, then cutting all that out for the chorus. My goal was to make "Thank God" be a big tension release, like waking from a nightmare and getting a big chest full of air.<br /><br />And by the way, it didn\'t escape my attention that Astronaut may very well be the profession which must follow the greatest amount of boring, tedious process. Even more so than Accountant, the other thing that every kid wants to grow up to be.'

[Verse 1]\n\
You\'re everything I want to be. You\'re everyone I want to be with me.\n\
Whenever I exist, that\'s the perfect time to think of you and me.\n\
I\'ll be the Abed to your Troy. I\'m the Belushi to your Akroyd.\n\
Caught in a mad bromance, just the two of us and some beer and TV.\n\
I\'ll find a way to make you see\n\

That if I were gay, I would be gay for you.\n\
I hope that doesn\'t make you feel uncomfortable.\n\
If you were a girl, I\'d be all over that,\n\
But here\'s the world we live in, and here\'s my song for you, my man crush.\n\
\n\
[Verse 2]\n\
Aren\'t all the good times just a blur? I climbed your fence, and snapped a picture.\n\
Your people helped me leave; maybe I can send a copy to you.\n\
You know that I\'m your biggest fan. I\'m here for you, because I love you man.\n\
Come get your man-hug here, like where you slap my back, and I slap yours too.\n\
We\'ve got mantivities to do.\n\
\n\

And if I were gay, I would be gay for you.\n\

But since you\'re not a girl, I think it\'s time to be my man crush.\n\

Please, don\'t turn out to be a jerk ball.\n\
Please, don\'t have politics that are different than mine.\n\
Please, don\'t do anything new; I like you just the way you are.\n\

[Verse 3]\n\
I know we\'ll be forever bros. We\'re mac and cheese. We\'re double rainbows.\n\
You can\'t believe how much goes into working out your traveling plans.\n\
I\'ve got my ticket in my hands.\n\
\n\
[Chorus 3]\n\
And if I were gay, I would be gay for you.\n\
Why does it seem to make you so uncomfortable to hear that\n\

How many love songs out there are truly original? This is my take on a platonic man-love song. Some stalking, a bit of how we objectify celebrities, and a whole bunch of poking fun at the whole "bromance" thing, like we need a name for guys who are good friends. A lot of the other bromantic songs seem to bang on the gay aspect pretty directly, and I wasn\'t really with that, as either hinting at or denying a gay angle isn\'t what this song is about. It seemed appropriate to attempt a kind of drive-by lampshading and then let it go. Of course, that happens at the beginning of the chorus, so I hit the subjunctive 3 times. Too much? </div><div><br /></div><div>The rhyme scheme is interesting in how it came about. I\'m very much against the idea that a word rhymes with itself. Most of that is because it doesn\'t. And yet, I had "me" and "me" in the first verse in an AAXA BBXBB pattern. No problem, I\'ll just redefine the rhyme scheme to use AAXB CCXBB. Now the first and second "me"s are not rhyming with each other. One is an A, one is a B, and it\'s just a coincidence they\'re both in the same rhyming family. So there. I compensated by going the rest of the song (that is, choruses and bridge) without rhyming at all, a practice with which I\'m becoming increasingly comfortable. </div><div><br /></div><div>The music has some obvious influences: Elton John, Billy Joel, Ben Folds, Alicia Keys...basically anyone who uses a lot of piano in popular music. Also felt some Sondheim happening, but then I can\'t really play anything with a bunch of Imaj7 and IVmaj7 without hearing "Pretty Women". Bonus shout out to No More Kings\' "About Schroeder" for the III7 to IV resolution. My instinct was to go to vi (treating the III7 as a V7/vi), but I liked the sound so I stole it. </div><div><br /></div><div>Ouch. That "different than" really is big fat in there, isn\'t it?

		notes: 'Ahh, contemporary a cappella. Been into it since I heard the Whiffenpoofs, Rockapella, and the Nylons in high school. Founded Controlled Mayhem with some other kids at school, then joined the Pomona College Men\'s Blue &amp; White in college, and was promptly exposed to the House Jacks at a West Coast CASA gathering. It was an eye opener, to say the least. They really got a full rock band sound out of just their bodies, and I was hooked. Due to funding (for equipment) difficulties, my college group never got mics and amps enough to do the really intense stuff. Later on joined a group in San Francisco and another in Florida. Nowadays, it can all be done in the computer, so it was time to try for a one-man attempt. </div><div><br /></div><div>Every sound here originates from my body. The bass is doubled down an octave from what I sang and eq\'ed to sound more like a real bass, because I\'m a tenor. I added a little amp model here, a little chorusing there, echo, reverb... it\'s not what I could actually reproduce in person if there were 6 of me. Still, I\'m happy this turned out so well. Had to do a lot of takes to get the intonation good enough, and almost said screw it I\'ll use Melodyne. For the record I\'m not ethically anti-autotune; it\'s just another tool. But under a deadline like I was, it actually takes more time to do the editing than it does to do a dozen takes and comp together the best parts of each. </div><div><br /></div><div>Oh yeah, and modulating back and forth a major 6th (or minor 3rd if you prefer). Fun. It\'s what Jonathan Coulton does in the song from Artificial Heart: "Tuscon Still Wants You To Dissolve, Sucker". Allowed me to get a nice big range and mood change when the chorus comes in. I originally had it up a minor 3rd, but that wasn\'t dramatic enough, so I decided on going up the major 6th. My voice is still recovering.'

Then she went off to a 2 week summer camp and my wife and I had 2 weeks to experience what life will be like when she goes off to college and it\'s just us. That break is why neither she nor I wanted to be official competitors this time around. With her return, we decided it was time to attempt a true collaboration, with us both writing music and lyrics, and us both singing.<div><br /></div><div>The challenge was to write a song inspired by <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_yK-wuBLjqs/UB2yiR5TAWI/AAAAAAAABvY/mtiwxwuwGI8/s1600/Steve+Photo.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this image</a>. In addition, since I hadn\'t written songs for the previous rounds, I thought it would be cool to catch up, in a manner of speaking. I couldn\'t manage to work in the round 2 challenge (inspirational "pumping up" music), but this song includes "last day of work" and "mini-opera" aspects from rounds 1 and 3 respectively.</div><div><br /></div><div>The concept was Zoe\'s, who happened to be reading The Lord of the Rings at the time. The two people singing are Samwise Gamgee (sung by me) and an elf girl that Zoe invented named Lorafaen. They are on the beach awaiting passage to Aman across the sea. I wrote Sam\'s lyrics and Zoe wrote Lorafaen\'s.</div><div><br /></div><div>Writing for two different voices was quite educational. Accommodating us both involved creative reaches in the form of key changes (5 of them), counterpoint, and harmony all primarily focused on keeping us both within comfortable ranges while still achieving motion in parallel with the emotion of the characters.</div><div><br /></div><div>Oh yeah, and I\'m not sure quite how this developed, but an A harmonic minor scale over a progression based on C major is really nice.

Nothing terribly groundbreaking about the music itself, but it got me to ponder what my composition style is. I decided I have 2 1/2 styles. This was chords first, and that seems to result pretty consistently in "normal" songs, musically. Then we have melody first songs like Friction Bill, Just a Dream, and Onward to the West, which tend to change keys a lot and wander, creating more unusual progressions. The outlier is One More Cloud, for which I started with lyrics, the only time I did that. In all cases I have a kernel of an idea with all elements combined as the hook from which I develop everything else. I have maybe a dozen hooks rattling around my head for songs I may write someday.\n\
\n\
For this song, I decided to try out my new guitar learnin\'. Been working on Travis fingerpicking lately, and I\'m getting decent at "Dust in the Wind", so I wrote this to use similar patterns. To make things easier, I weirded up the chords by removing complexity from the fingerings. So an Am becomes an Aadd2 or an Am7 to remove a finger here and there. Little things like that throughout to make it easier to play.',

Here we are at the end of things, your heads on the chopping block.\n\
Who gets pulled, and who pulls the strings? It starts here. Walkers gonna walk.\n\
\n\
To the light, undead brethren, robbed of faculties, sentenced not to talk.\n\
So let us be a voice for you. You do what you do. Walkers gonna walk.\n\
\n\
You\'re out there starving in the wilderness. You\'re out there groping in the dark.\n\
We\'re here to represent the dispossessed, so stand up!\n\
\n\
Now\'s the time for equality. You were people too, made of common stock.\n\
So collect yourselves and take your plea to the streets. Walkers gonna walk.\n\
\n\
To us norms: lay your conscience bare, and rage against the ticking of the clock.\n\
Hearts and brains… we\'ve got lots to share. It\'s only fair. Walkers gonna walk.\n\

Walkers gonna walk. Walkers gonna walk. Everybody walk!',

This may be the latest in the week I\'ve ever gone without any hint of a solid idea. Then I remembered the Zombie Walk for Hunger last year. Zombie walks are usually done for fun or performance art, but on this occasion they did it to protest hunger and raise awareness and donations to the cause. I really liked the metaphor. Taken directly, who is more hungry than a zombie? And on the ironic flip side, it casts a light on the inhumanity with which we tend to view the hungry, so as to justify ignoring them. By taking something inhuman (and hungry) like zombies and protesting for their human treatment, it makes giving to the human needy seem more possible. <span style="line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt">All kinds of parallels, like their lack of a voice, groping for a way out, etc.</span></div><div><span style="line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt">I thought it was an awesome metaphor, so decided to write a song that could work on both levels. Either it\'s a literal zombie rights song (at a benefit concert in the town of Woodbury from The Walking Dead), or a protest to raise hunger awareness at a Zombie Walk. For this reason I intentionally used an outdoor setting (long city-street reverb, crowd noise) to support both ideas.</span></div><div><br /></div><div>I think the 9/8 time gives the whole song a kind of lurching, unsteady feel that fits with the concept, especially with the rhythm pattern of 2\'s for the first 2 triplets and 3\'s on the third. You almost expect it to be in common time and then find an extra 8th note at the end.</div><div><br /></div><div>The overall structure was uncomfortable to me, being used to verse/chorus/bridge. But I wanted a lot of energy right at the beginning, so I started with a high, loud note and ended the first stanza with the hook. I felt a thematic repeat at that point would be tolerable, then a different movement was in order before returning, completing an AABA block. I could have done a second bridge after that, but decided that in a live concert setting an instrumental solo (over the bridge chords) would go over better, then return to the main theme to end it. Overall, almost like the structure in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/briangraymusic/songs/one-of-us" target="_blank">One of Us</a>, but I hope done in a manner that gets less repetitive.</div><div><br /></div><div>It seems in every song I do there\'s one little word or phrase that I really like. Typically it\'s some kind of double-meaning, and I know what it is in this song: "dispossessed." In addition to the actual meaning of "physically or spiritually homeless or deprived of security", it occurred to me that when a person is "possessed", they have a second consciousness in them. So what\'s the opposite? Having the first consciousness removed of course! So zombies are "dispossessed". Heh.'

[Verse 1]\n\
The calm before the storm. The turning of my\n\
Socket calls to mind an old-time barrel organ grinder and his...\n\
Friend? A twist and there\'s a stage. A twist and there\'s a\n\
Ferris wheel, the fair is real, it\'s time!\n\
The lights and the music, excitement and fusion of\n\
Wonder and energy here in the carnival of my soul.\n\
I want to conduct the electrical motion\n\
A tamer, magician, or acrobat under the pole. Everything in control.\n\
\n\
[Chorus 1]\n\
Someday, I\'ll advance to be the dancing monkey on display,\n\
Cause if it\'s true that\'s what you do, I guess it\'s what you do\n\
Until it\'s time for me to headline the midway.\n\
And someday, I am sure to be securing life as it\'s designed.\n\
It\'s just my part in reaching farther than the popcorn cart.\n\
I\'m sure, I\'ve nothing more to do but grind.\n\

Alonzo and his cats, Leela on the\n\
Ring stock showing scars and limps in payment for their stars upon the bill.\n\
A drink to mask the ache, and deeper ache,\n\
As if the booze could disabuse my drive!\n\
And Buddy the zanie and Hooper the trainer\n\
Are under the thrall of a pitch that is almost convincing.\n\
And here all around me are people who know\n\
What it\'s like to be one of the people who enter the ring. Which is the only thing.\n\
\n\
[Chorus 2]\n\
So someday, I might chance to be the dancing monkey on display,\n\
Cause if they say that\'s what you do, then I\'ll believe it\'s true.\n\
Just wait in line until my time to join the cabaret.\n\
And someday, I\'ll be sure I can endure whatever life I find,\n\
Playing my part among the martyrs to a work of art.\n\
To start, all that I have to do is grind.\n\
\n\
[Chorus 3]\n\
Someday, as you\'re glancing at the dancing monkey on display,\n\
Though it may fool you into ooh-ing at the big to-do,\n\
Spare a thought for one who\'s taught this was the only way.\n\
And someday, when I ought to have forgotten options left behind,\n\
I could be smart and have the heart to give up and restart.\n\
Til then, I\'m churning again my daily grind.',

Turns out this is a closed drive-in theater, but when I first saw it I immediately thought of a desert fairground, either ready to be occupied or recently vacated. So a song about the optimism of a carnival about to exist, or a more somber tone of leaving and moving on (much like Billy Joel\'s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bdtuwPpQIk" target="_blank">"Famous Last Words"</a>). Then the vibrant, almost supernatural colors made me think of the show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carniv%C3%A0le" target="_blank">Carnivàle</a>. Then I don\'t even know how, but the eventual song idea just came to me the next morning.\n\
\n\
I feel pretty hypocritical now for harshing on other people\'s inconsistent characterizations in my capacity as a judge for <a href="http://spintunes.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">SpinTunes</a>. My POV character is a carnival roustabout, the kind of person likely to be less educated, less economically advantaged, and yet here I am putting words like "disabuse", "thrall", and "martyr", phrases like "calls to mind", and a whole host of internal rhymes into his mouth. This was a conscious, if uneasy decision. The source of it comes from a disassociative attempt at telling two stories at once. On the surface, the primary metaphor is an organ grinder feeling like all he does is turn the crank. Everyone pays attention to the monkey and his job is a mindless one that could probably be replaced by a machine. Likewise, the carnival worker longs to be one of the performers, but as the song goes on we find that advancing to the big stage is not without its drawbacks. Secondarily though, I wished to have a story under the surface about normal people in everyday life looking for advancement in their own jobs before discovering the toll the higher, more prestigious positions take on them in the corporate world. That\'s why this guy doesn\'t speak strictly like a roustabout, though I made sure to put in plenty of carnival lingo like "ring stock" (animal performers).\n\
\n\
Backing up the narrator\'s duality, I tried to get as much of the same into the music. The most obvious is probably the two different time signatures. The first time we get to the fast 12/8, the tone changes to a high-energy, carnival-starting-now mode, whereas the second we\'re just following through a train of thought where he starts to recognize how green his coworkers\' grass isn\'t. Adding to this is a duality in the harmonies, moving between an Em/G feel and a Eb/Ab feel, and to a lesser extent lyrics that vary between rhyming in pretty random places, or not at all for a while, to a chorus with a strict rhyme scheme.\n\
\n\
My original intent for the orchestration was to include lots of circus instruments (woodwinds, brass, pipes). Unfortunately my migration from old computer to new left all my added instruments behind. I made do with a Logic-resident piano and drum set, but I could see redoing this in the future when I get things sorted.\

		notes: 'An interesting adventure in songwriting. From the beginning I had the idea of doing this one as a single melody line and nothing else. So what does that affect? Well by definition the presentation is simple. Let\'s ride that simplicity throughout the process: 2 melodic patterns, each with only 4 lines of lyrics. Basic chord progressions. Masculine rhyme throughout (except lines 1 &amp; 3 of the bridge sections). Not sure if the ABACxBC/ABxCABC rhyme scheme stands out in its complexity and maybe I should have simplified that too.<div><br /></div><div>Also simple, and hopefully relatable, is the concept. As I witness my daughter absorbed in imagination, I can remember how that felt when I was younger, but I just can\'t seem to immerse myself in the same way anymore. Sure, there\'s role playing and creative activities such as... well, writing songs. But visiting for a couple hours at a time. I\'m not living there anymore. It\'s not really so sad as the song makes it seem, but sometimes you just feel like committing to an emotion.</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, the melody. Essentially the entire song is communicated via lyrics and melody, so I had to compose with a different mindset. Lots of scales to establish the harmonic setting. When a trickier chord like the Fmaj7 in the bridge happens, no better way than to arpeggiate it. And other than that Bb midway through the bridges, the things I could do to make them stand out were a shift in register (down), and energy in the performance (up). Can you tell that I use a D7 to lead back into the verse?</div><div><br /></div><div>I\'m really digging the concept of an expander. Others of my songs have had enough going on instrumentally that a little noise in the vocals didn\'t matter much. But with ONLY vocals, it matters a lot. Once I got that hiss out, the whole song opened up and feels like it\'s in a large hall. I think I\'ll carry this technique forward into more songs. Another thing I learned by isolating my voice is that it sounds smoother when I roll off the top end. Even in songs that need the highs in the form of cymbals, brass, etc. could probably benefit from less of that in the lead vocals. I\'ll play with this in the future too.</div><div><br /></div><div>Extra Credit: Who wants to take some manner of guess as to how many hours I listened to Mandy Patinkin while learning to sing? Hint: your guess is low.'

What\'s up with that? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtJbk7qJkug" target="_blank">He really does mess up pretty much everything</a>. Still, he must go to bed sad a lot. <span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:1.25;background-color:transparent">I actually imagine him in bed singing this the night before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD0pqDOAtk" target="_blank">that scene when Superman talks to Lex and Lex makes Otis erase Otisburg from the overlay</a>. Of course the song also mentions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FrTmrkkVbo" target="_blank">the ladder scene in Superman II</a>, so the timelines don\'t exactly match up with that...</span><div><br /></div><div>I\'m not entirely sure what key this is in. The A7 that serves as the verse tonic seems very bluesy, but I go from that to F, D7, G which to me feels like a IV-V7/V-V in C. And in fact the chorus resolves to C. But then at the end of the chorus I use the E7 (used as a V7/vi in the chorus) to resolve back to A7, so we\'re back to a kind of blues A that just maybe uses C a lot as a secondary key. I wanted to create a distinction between the stressful, oppressive daily routine and his daydreaming, so I chose a verse/chorus dichotomy with the hard quarter note beat that opens up to the chorused guitar on "I don\'t mind". But I can\'t allow poor Otis to enjoy it. As soon as he says "Otisburg" I felt the need to cut him off and drag him back to reality as quickly as possible. And then the ending just implies that this continues perpetually.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Milestone: I actually played (most of) the instruments. 2 acoustic (both on my Seagull) and 2 electric guitar (Agile) tracks plus all voices. Only the drums and bass are software instruments. And I\'m confident I could have played in the bass if I had one, but I really don\'t know when I\'ll feel like going through the trouble of mic\'ing a drum set. I\'ll probably wait on that until I can afford to go into a studio and use one already set up. My recording equipment can only handle 2 inputs at a time anyway.</div><div><br /></div><div>Oh yeah, and in case you missed it the first half of the solo after the 2nd chorus is the "March of the Villains" leitmotif from the movie. Officially it\'s assigned primarily to Lex, but I found it playing more often when Otis was doing his thing.'

		notes: 'So this was an interesting, and emotionally taxing challenge: "<i>Finally! Your favorite book is being made into a decent movie! The producers need a title song to promote the film and hopefully win an Academy Award.</i>"<div><br /></div><div>I\'ve been on a genealogy kick lately, tracing my heritage through the US and out to Europe. I always knew my mom\'s side was all Ashkenazi, and sure enough all four grandparents from that side come by way of Russia, but with German surnames (Graß, Wasserman, Schechtel). None of them experienced the holocaust first-hand, as they got here in the late 19th century. But the reasons for being in Russia in the first place and then having to move again were the exact same pre-existing oppression and pogroms that so easily morphed into Nazi Germany. Oddly, half of my father\'s side comes from the exact same region of Baden in southwestern Germany (Schlierstadt, Schillingstadt, Grotzingen, Hainstadt), but they were not Jewish. It\'s not unimaginable that half of my family oppressed -- or helped out -- the other half.</div><div><br /></div><div>Growing up a Jewish child, of course I heard about the holocaust every Sunday morning, to the point of becoming numb. To a child it was all so long ago, and so far away that I may as well have been hearing about the Norman invasion.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art Spiegelman wrote and illustrated the graphic novel "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maus</a>", portraying himself receiving his father\'s oral history of his experiences in Germany. Through this exchange, I and many others have been able to see what happens on a very personal level. It moved me enough to write this song, to be used when it is finally made into a movie (Mr. Spiegelman has been approached, and declined to pursue a cinematic adaptation).</div><div><br /></div><div>The part of the challenge about "promoting" the film piqued my interest, as two particular methods of doing so stood out. One, if the song is played on the radio, of course that might get people interested. Secondly, the trailer. I imagine pieces of the score would be used as the trailer begins, with dialogue overlain. But then there\'s that part near the end where scenes rip by to a faster theme with a more continuous flow. This song is meant to be chopped up and have the chorus be used for that part of the trailer. Like the book, the song cannot escape being sad, but it\'s tempered by the idea that we are all made up of not just what happens to us now, but how we got here in the first place.'

[Chorus]\n\
\n\
[Bridge]\n\
Ah yes, my old friend, you are a master of this game.\n\
The hidden blade when you pretend that you don\'t even know my name. Well played.\n\
\n\
[Verse 3]\n\
Sometimes it\'s hard to tell if you even notice me. Maybe it\'s just as well. It\'s better you don\'t see\n\
The way I\'m running just to keep your back in view, in your shadow waiting for the perfect moment.\n\
\n\

		lyrics: '\
[Verse 1]\n\
Fei gong! Time to take the field and get along in harmony.\n\
Stay strong. passively resisting all who cheer for us to fight (fight! fight!) for vict\'ry.\n\
Steadfast, firm, and noncombative, we advance the golden rule.\n\
So let the games commence where we only play defense at the Spring and Autumn Mohist School!\n\
\n\
[Verse 2]\n\
Fei gong! Impartial care\'s our universal tapestry to weave.\n\
Our song tells a tale of struggle wherein two teams enter, two teams leave.\n\
Respect, unselfishness, and sportsmanship shall be be our crowning jewel.\n\
For the inner peace you\'ve missed, trade your fist for pacifist at the Spring and Autumn Mohist School!'
