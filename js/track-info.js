Some holidays just get the short end of the stick. Why is it that days based on mathematical constants (you know who you are) lack the public awareness of days marking religious or historical significance? It\'s just not rational.\n\n\
Thanks to <a href="http://www.weirdal.com/" target="_blank">Weird Al</a> and his "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t039p6xqutU" target="_blank">Christmas at Ground Zero</a>" for the idea to give it a holiday sound by using sleigh bells. I was thinking about using the baritone sax as well, but decided it didn\'t work in this case.\n\n\
EDIT: New version for π Day 2013! I rethought the sax and decided it works after all. Added a uke, accordion, and moving left hand on the piano, and kicked up the energy. Hope you like it. '

[Verse 1]\n\
I don\'t seem to sleep a lot now when it\'s raining.\n\
I don\'t need to watch my step, I know this road.\n\
The winter snaps at my skin. I guess that I should care, or something,\n\
But I don\'t seem to notice lately when it\'s cold.\n\
Breath embraces the mist, becomes it, hides away in the shadows.\n\
There\'s nothing left but letting go,\n\
\n\
[Chorus]\n\
And then there\'s one more cloud.\n\
Like a final breath into the wind, she dances away.\n\
And the tolling echoes loudly,\n\
And the raindrops eat away, bite by bite \'til nothing remains\n\
And as the chiming fades it\'s 3 a.m. I must be lonely.\n\

[Verse 2]\n\
She\'d have wanted to be somewhere else that\'s warmer.\n\
She always liked herself a sunny, tropic shore.\n\
Who knows? Maybe that\'s where she\'ll be carried, maybe not,\n\
But this is really not about her anymore.\n\
Every word that was said or wasn\'t, every torturous regret\n\
All I can do is let them go,\n\

A life in ashes and a raincoat, and immutable, final loss\n\
The simple act of letting go,\n\

[Verse 1]\n\
So today\'s the day I finally bridge the strait of Charybdis and Scylla,\n\
Dividing secrets of my heart,\n\
Disobey instinct and circumnavigate the 800 lb gorilla,\n\
Forever keeping us apart\n\
And I\'ve bet the farm I won\'t end up\n\
Harming the lady cradled in my arm, while you journey up to me.\n\
\n\
[Chorus]\n\
So I guess I\'ve been playing hard to get, what with these springs and barrels.\n\
To be or not to be beset, by Cupid\'s slings and arrows.\n\
But I think it\'s time for you to find out what you haven\'t found out yet:\n\
That I\'m not so hard to get.\n\
\n\
[Verse 2]\n\
I got my big brother\'s plan to imitate, followed almost to the letter:\n\
One decoy girl to apprehend.\n\
Gonna try now to ascend the Empire State, with the consequences better.\n\
I\'ll get my plumber in the end.\n\
It\'s not so simple to scale Olympus,\n\
But you inspire this humble chimp to embrace our destiny.\n\

I\'m not some raiding faun to your Diana. I want to know what makes you you.\n\
I feel there\'s flavors here besides banana, and I feel you feel it too.\n\

[Verse 3]\n\
And I know you dream of honor\'s greater share, like Henry and his neighbors.\n\
Your battle all the fates demand.\n\
Set aglow your heart as guide, and don\'t despair the Sisyphean labors\n\
You will endure to win my hand.\n\
Then we\'ll discover the secret\n\
Of the ones who inspire songs of love, and touch immortality.\n\

Hey there, it may be just my current state,\n\
But I swear, I haven\'t seen a girl like you since 1348.\n\
And really by then she was almost gone.\n\
You\'ve got that "absence of boils and pus" thing really going on.\n\
I bet you hear that all the time.\n\
If I just behave a bit less grim for now would that be such a crime?\n\
Decade by decade they work me to the bone.\n\
Enough is enough, it\'s time to reap what I\'ve sown.\n\

So hello, world! Here I am just in from\n\

Forty-seven hours and like twenty minutes left. Show me what you\'ve got.\n\

I don\'t sweat the weight I\'ve always just been skin and bones without the skin.\n\

Lalalalalalala never mind, just pass one over here.\n\
Between the famines, war, and crime,\n\
I burn out, the travel kicks my ass with boots of unpaid overtime.\n\
All for some glorified naked chimpanzee.\n\
Hey, no offense, but you people\'s deaths suck for me.\n\

Just today, this famous entertainer said offensive things, and now the world is all offended.\n\
Hard to say out of all the worthy artists nominated who will win the big award.\n\
A person I should know about is divorcing after not too long a time.\n\
And I can\'t believe it. That\'s news to me.\n\

Dog bit man last night. It\'s right there in black and white.\n\
Should I care somehow despite my TPS report due tomorrow?\n\

There\'s a place far away from here where two adjacent countries don\'t agree upon their borders.\n\
The human race now totals seven billion people who have stories each unique in their own way.\n\

Kind of a folk-style buddy song for this one. We\'re still together, Descartes and I, and since I wrote this song you\'ll be pleased to know he\'s achieved somewhat of an internet presence.

Maybe he thought people would be more accepting of a velocirator who looks more like what they saw in Jurassic Park.\n\

Nothing terribly groundbreaking about the music itself, but it got me to ponder what my composition style is. I decided I have 2 1/2 styles. This was chords first, and that seems to result pretty consistently in "normal" songs, musically. Then we have melody first songs like Friction Bill, Just a Dream, and Onward to the West, which tend to change keys a lot and wander, creating more unusual progressions. The outlier is One More Cloud, for which I started with lyrics, the only time I did that. In all cases I have a kernel of an idea with all elements combined as the hook from which I develop everything else. I have maybe a dozen hooks rattling around my head for songs I may write someday.\n\
\n\
For this song, I decided to try out my new guitar learnin\'. Been working on Travis fingerpicking lately, and I\'m getting decent at "Dust in the Wind", so I wrote this to use similar patterns. To make things easier, I weirded up the chords by removing complexity from the fingerings. So an Am becomes an Aadd2 or an Am7 to remove a finger here and there. Little things like that throughout to make it easier to play.',

Here we are at the end of things, your heads on the chopping block.\n\
Who gets pulled, and who pulls the strings? It starts here. Walkers gonna walk.\n\

To the light, undead brethren, robbed of faculties, sentenced not to talk.\n\
So let us be a voice for you. You do what you do. Walkers gonna walk.\n\

You\'re out there starving in the wilderness. You\'re out there groping in the dark.\n\
We\'re here to represent the dispossessed, so stand up!\n\

Now\'s the time for equality. You were people too, made of common stock.\n\
So collect yourselves and take your plea to the streets. Walkers gonna walk.\n\

To us norms: lay your conscience bare, and rage against the ticking of the clock.\n\
Hearts and brains… we\'ve got lots to share. It\'s only fair. Walkers gonna walk.\n\

[Verse 1]\n\
The calm before the storm. The turning of my\n\
Socket calls to mind an old-time barrel organ grinder and his...\n\
Friend? A twist and there\'s a stage. A twist and there\'s a\n\
Ferris wheel, the fair is real, it\'s time!\n\
The lights and the music, excitement and fusion of\n\
Wonder and energy here in the carnival of my soul.\n\
I want to conduct the electrical motion\n\
A tamer, magician, or acrobat under the pole. Everything in control.\n\
\n\
[Chorus 1]\n\
Someday, I\'ll advance to be the dancing monkey on display,\n\
Cause if it\'s true that\'s what you do, I guess it\'s what you do\n\
Until it\'s time for me to headline the midway.\n\
And someday, I am sure to be securing life as it\'s designed.\n\
It\'s just my part in reaching farther than the popcorn cart.\n\
I\'m sure, I\'ve nothing more to do but grind.\n\
\n\
[Verse 2]\n\
Alonzo and his cats, Leela on the\n\
Ring stock showing scars and limps in payment for their stars upon the bill.\n\
A drink to mask the ache, and deeper ache,\n\
As if the booze could disabuse my drive!\n\
And Buddy the zanie and Hooper the trainer\n\
Are under the thrall of a pitch that is almost convincing.\n\
And here all around me are people who know\n\
What it\'s like to be one of the people who enter the ring. Which is the only thing.\n\
\n\
[Chorus 2]\n\
So someday, I might chance to be the dancing monkey on display,\n\
Cause if they say that\'s what you do, then I\'ll believe it\'s true.\n\
Just wait in line until my time to join the cabaret.\n\
And someday, I\'ll be sure I can endure whatever life I find,\n\
Playing my part among the martyrs to a work of art.\n\
To start, all that I have to do is grind.\n\
\n\
[Chorus 3]\n\
Someday, as you\'re glancing at the dancing monkey on display,\n\
Though it may fool you into ooh-ing at the big to-do,\n\
Spare a thought for one who\'s taught this was the only way.\n\
And someday, when I ought to have forgotten options left behind,\n\
I could be smart and have the heart to give up and restart.\n\
Til then, I\'m churning again my daily grind.',

Turns out this is a closed drive-in theater, but when I first saw it I immediately thought of a desert fairground, either ready to be occupied or recently vacated. So a song about the optimism of a carnival about to exist, or a more somber tone of leaving and moving on (much like Billy Joel\'s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bdtuwPpQIk" target="_blank">"Famous Last Words"</a>). Then the vibrant, almost supernatural colors made me think of the show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carniv%C3%A0le" target="_blank">Carnivàle</a>. Then I don\'t even know how, but the eventual song idea just came to me the next morning.\n\
\n\
I feel pretty hypocritical now for harshing on other people\'s inconsistent characterizations in my capacity as a judge for <a href="http://spintunes.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">SpinTunes</a>. My POV character is a carnival roustabout, the kind of person likely to be less educated, less economically advantaged, and yet here I am putting words like "disabuse", "thrall", and "martyr", phrases like "calls to mind", and a whole host of internal rhymes into his mouth. This was a conscious, if uneasy decision. The source of it comes from a disassociative attempt at telling two stories at once. On the surface, the primary metaphor is an organ grinder feeling like all he does is turn the crank. Everyone pays attention to the monkey and his job is a mindless one that could probably be replaced by a machine. Likewise, the carnival worker longs to be one of the performers, but as the song goes on we find that advancing to the big stage is not without its drawbacks. Secondarily though, I wished to have a story under the surface about normal people in everyday life looking for advancement in their own jobs before discovering the toll the higher, more prestigious positions take on them in the corporate world. That\'s why this guy doesn\'t speak strictly like a roustabout, though I made sure to put in plenty of carnival lingo like "ring stock" (animal performers).\n\
\n\
Backing up the narrator\'s duality, I tried to get as much of the same into the music. The most obvious is probably the two different time signatures. The first time we get to the fast 12/8, the tone changes to a high-energy, carnival-starting-now mode, whereas the second we\'re just following through a train of thought where he starts to recognize how green his coworkers\' grass isn\'t. Adding to this is a duality in the harmonies, moving between an Em/G feel and a Eb/Ab feel, and to a lesser extent lyrics that vary between rhyming in pretty random places, or not at all for a while, to a chorus with a strict rhyme scheme.\n\
\n\
My original intent for the orchestration was to include lots of circus instruments (woodwinds, brass, pipes). Unfortunately my migration from old computer to new left all my added instruments behind. I made do with a Logic-resident piano and drum set, but I could see redoing this in the future when I get things sorted.\

We goin\' clubbin\' tonight. The stars are out, and the moon is right for goin\' clubbin\' tonight.\n\

[Verse 1] Sun lights the\n\
Goal, time to roll for control of the water hole.\n\
Poor soul caught me on the knoll,\n\
Patrolling the territory, it\'s scary for me,\n\
But very glorious, when I\'m victorious.\n\
You want a stab at this? Piece of the Habilis?\n\
Better not to miss a chance to grab a kiss\n\
Goodbye, we gonna deny, cause here in July,\n\
The water supply\'s going dry. Case you\'re wondering\n\
Why I flex at you, go on, check my crew.\n\
Bid your next adieu, then perplex it through.\n\
Blunts or blades, I\'m something of a connoisseur\n\
Jack of all trades: hunter and a gatherer.\n\

But we got us fire and a quest therefore.\n\
Inventing a lever, getting all clever, chasing\n\
Forever, and never saying never is a mammoth\n\
Endeavor for anyone, but plenty fun. I got\n\
Twenty tons of many sons, each with opposable\n\
Thumbs, a strong bite, more hair than I\'d hoped,\n\
Walk: upright. Forehead: sloped. In a\n\
Land that time forgot, you cannot get\n\
Caught on the spot a lot, brain all tied in a\n\
Knot. So with the fall of the light, gear up right.\n\
I\'m invitin\' you to use this item to\n\
Smite \'em. It\'s chiseled from a single piece of clubbintonite.\n\

[Verse 3] That\'s right I\'m the\n\
Future, no dispute sir. You must concur\n\
I\'m losing my fur, causin\' a stir. Unless you\n\
Prefer the NTs back in our midst\n\
And the sleestack who frankly don\'t really exist. That\'s a\n\
Myth perpetuated by the smith of the monolith.\n\
You read the glyph, you catch my drift, but that\'s a\n\
Riff for another time, another rhyme, my\n\
Primary point at this time is to tell you that\n\
I\'m the allegorical oracle. It\'s not\n\
Metaphorical to mention that I kick it prehistorical.\n\
Muscles granitic, troglodytic, but analytic.\n\
Yeah, I\'m my own worst critic.\n\
It\'s sick, you be all frontin\' with your invite:\n\
